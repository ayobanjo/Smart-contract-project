# Smart-contract-project
# Description
Examined Solidity smart contracts to identify and categorize vulnerabilities like reentrancy and access control issues, enhancing security in decentralized applications.

As part of the Webacy externship, this project involved analyzing and labeling smart contract vulnerabilities to enhance security in smart contracts. This project focused on identifying and categorizing critical security vulnerabilities in smart contracts by examining Solidity code, applying risk labels, and providing insights to improve blockchain security.

# Methodology

Understanding Smart Contract Risks: Researched common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflows, and access control issues.
Reviewed industry best practices and existing risk taxonomies.

Labeling Process:
Examined smart contract code snippets.
Applied a standardized tagging system to classify vulnerabilities.
Documented findings with explanations and severity ratings.

Analysis:
Data preparation and Frequency analysis
Correlation analysis
Clustering techniques and interpretation of results

Validation & Reporting:
Cross-checked identified vulnerabilities against known security benchmarks.
Prepared reports summarizing vulnerability trends and mitigation strategies.
